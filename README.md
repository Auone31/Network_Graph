# Network_Graph
Code generates and draws a network graph. This project will later be integrated with a C++ implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm. The graphs will be used to show connectivity and shortest paths as calculated by Dijkstra's algorithms. The code invokes Python engine with C++ and utilizes matplotlib to generate the figures.

# Dependencies

1 - Python 2.7 (Python.h)

2 - matplotlib
