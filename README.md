# Network_Graph
Code generates and draws a network graph.

# Dependencies

1 - Python 2.7 (Python.h)

2 - matplotlib

# Description

The code generates and draws a network graph with uniformly distributed vertices (please see Sample_Graph.png above). This project will later be integrated with a C++ implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm. The graphs will be used to show connectivity and shortest paths as calculated by Dijkstra's algorithms. The code invokes Python engine within C++ and utilizes matplotlib to generate the figures.

Users can specify:

i) The source vertex (Will be shown as red in graph)

ii) The maximum number of vertices

iii) The maximum Euclidean distance that two nodes can have to form an edge between them

Any feedback would be highly appreciated!!!

Enjoy!!!
